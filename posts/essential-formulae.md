### SI Units

[[SI units for various measures]]

### Hooke's law

$$F = -k * \Delta x$$

The restoring force of a spring is the negative of the spring constant times the extension of the spring.

### Elastic potential energy

$$U_e = \frac{1}{2}k\Delta x$$

Where k is the spring constant and $\Delta x$ is the extension.

### Kinetic energy

$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$

Kinetic energy is equal to half times the mass times the velocity squared.

### Work

Work is the amount of work done by a force (not sure how to explain it simpler than that).

$$W = F * \Delta x$$

Work is equal to force times displacement. It is a measure of energy which means it is in joules.

### Gravitational energy

$$E_g = m*g*\Delta h$$

Gravitational potential energy is equal to mass times the acceleration of gravity times the change in height.
