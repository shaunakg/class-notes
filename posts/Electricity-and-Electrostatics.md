## Electrokinetics

- Ohm's law
- Series and parallel circuits

### Electric energy

- Light
- Heat
- Mechanical power
- Electromagnetic field

#### How is the energy transported from the power source to the light bulb (for example)?

Free electrons move through the circuit. They are attracted to the opposite terminal. Electrons move at about 1 millimeter per second, $U_{el} = 1$mm/s. However electricity travels almost instantly. This shows that the electrons are not transporting the energy - the energy travels as electromagnetic waves. The waves carry the electrons and express energy.

### Measures of electric energy

#### Intensity of the current

$$I = \frac{q}{t} = \frac{\text{electric charge (coulombs)}}{\text{time (seconds)}}$$

The unit for 'intensity' is A or amperes. 

#### Electric charge

$q$ is the electric charge. The electric charge is a property of elementary particles manifested in attractional and repelling forces. It affects the following particles (**and more**):

- Electrons/positrons
- Quarks
- Muons
- Neutrinos
- Protons

#### Conservation of electric charge

Conservation means that something is preserved or kept the same. Electric charge cannot be destroyed or created in and isolated system. It stays constant.

#### The electric charge is quantized

Quantized means that the electric charge is discrete. An electron has a specific electric change and a proton has another specific electric charge. If both these particles are in a system then the total electric energy of the system is $c_{electron} + c_{proton}$. BUT, quantized means that you cannot split this charge up into arbitrary pieces. So electric charge is like cash and coins, not a credit card.

Therefore, when computing the charge of a system of electrons, $q = n * e$ which means total electric charge is equal to the number of electrons times the charge of a single electron. We can substitute this in our electric charge equation:

$$I = \frac{q}{t} = \frac{ne}{t}$$

#### Electric potential

$$V = \frac{\text{electric energy (joules)}}{\text{electric charge (coulombs)}}$$

The unit for electric potential is the volt. The **voltage is different from the volt**. Voltage is a measure of the change in electric potential, so it is actually $\Delta V$.

In this image, electric potential is measured in volts but the voltage is the difference between potentials before and after the appliance.
