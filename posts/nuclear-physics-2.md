## Energy-mass correlation ($e = mc^2$)

## How fission and fusion yield energy

The nucleus is held together with a certain binding energy. When nuclear fission or fusion is performed on a nucleus, the nucleus breaks apart and releases this energy.

Heavier nuclei have more binding energy. Therefore fission can be performed on them to release this energy.

Lighter nuclei have less binding energy. Therefore fusion can be performed on them.

Fusion swaps to fission at around Iron-56.

### Atomic masses

Atomic masses have a relation to normal mass. They are measured using atomic mass units (symbol $u$).

$$1u=1.66054*10^{-27}\text{kg}$$

### Atomic equations

$$\ce{^{235}_{92}U} +\ce{^{1}_{0}n} \rarr \ce{^{236}_{92}U\ast} \rarr \ce{^{90}_{37}Rb} +\ce{^{143}_{55}Cs} + \ce{3^{1}_{0}n} + \text{energy} + \bold{Q}$$
