## Comparative structure explained
A comparative structure **still contains** a/an:
- introduction
- body paragraphs (3 usually)
- conclusion
## Unpacking an essay prompt
### Step 1: Interrogate the question and reword it until it makes sense to you
- Define the words and **what they mean in the context of the question** as well as any other context (e.g historical)

### Step 2: Do I agree or disagree with this questions? (e.g what is my contention?)
- **Not just yes or no**, some prompts can allow for a wide variety of opinions.
- Make sure to actually stay within the limits of the prompt when constructing a contention.
## Example prompt
> In Montana 1948 and To Kill a Mockingbird, justice is undermined by prejudice. Discuss.
### Unpacking
- This is about two books which have been previously studied, which are *Montana 1948* and *To Kill a Mockingbird*
- Therefore the context of the prompt (e.g the justice and prejudice) refer to the context of the books.

### Contention
- In this prompt, I will take the 'for' side because there are multiple examples in the book where justice is undermined by prejudice.
