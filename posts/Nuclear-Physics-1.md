## History of nuclear testing

There is not meant to be any more nuclear testing in the world after the various treaties that have been signed.

## Nuclear fusion

Nuclear fusion occurs inside the sun and in the center of all stars. It is the process that produces the energy the sun gives to us.

### Summary of fusion

- Fusion is the opposite of fission: the combination of two smaller atomic nuclei into larger atomic nuclei.
- Been occurring inside the sun and other stars for billion years. This is called **stellar nucleosynthesis**.
- Electrostatic forces will repel two nuclei, at high speeds they may have enough kinetic energy to overcome the repulsive forces.
- In a star the high energy leads to high temperature.

Nuclei of two heavy forms of isotopes of hydrogen i.e deuterium and tritium react for production of energy in nuclear reactors: 

$$_1^2H + _1^3H \to _2^5He \to _2^4He + _0^1n+energy$$

### Nuclear fusion in the sun

- Two protons (hydrogen nuclei) fuse together forming a hydrogen isotope, deuterium.
    - One of the protons has decayed, forming a neutron, a neutrino, a positron and releasing energy.
- During the fusion of a proton and neutrium (H-2) into helium-3, the nucleons lose mass and energy is released.
- The fusion of helium-3 nuclei results in the fomation of a helium-4 nucleus and releases two protons and energy.

### Einstein's Equation

$$E = mc^2$$

- E = energy (J)
- m = mass (kg)
- c = speed of light in air = $3 * 10^8$m/s
- The mass of a nucleus is always less than the mass of its individual nucleons.
- Mass can be thought of as a property of energy (they are not quite the same thing)
- Nuclei are moad
