# Closing the gap

The close the gap campaign aims to close the health and life expectancy gap between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and non-indigenous Australians within a generation.

It is a joint initiative between all levels of government and a Coalition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peak Organisations.

## What is the gap

The gap refers to the vast health and life expectation inequality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.

> Indigenous children are dying at almost three times the rate of non-Indigenous children in Australia.

# Case studies

## Otitis media

- Inflammation of the middle
    - Bacteria
    - Viruses
- Hearing loss in Indigenous children aged 1-14 is 3 times higher than the rate for non-Indigenous children.
- Largely attributed to underdiagnoses and treatment.
    - Linked to access and education.
- BUT the time in which children have this is in the periods of critical brain development.
- Hearing loss during this period can be devastating for brain development - and it happens more to Indigenous people.

## Rheumatic fever

- Simple bacterial infection
- Triggers autoimmune response
- Easily treated with penicillin but high mortality rate in Indigenous kids
- 86% of Indigenous Australians don't receive the full course of antibiotics.
- Repeated infections can lead to mitral valve disease - requiring open heart surgery to treat.
- Arnhem Land has the highest rate in the WORLD.

# Contributing factors

There are many complex factors.

- Socioeconomic status and living conditions.
- Lack of resources in remote communities.
- High incidence of out of home case.
- Access to healthcare.
- Treatment compliance
    - Language barrier - patient may not understand the treatment.

# Consequences of chronic childhood disease

- Reduced life expectancy
- Permanent disability
- Prolonged school absenteeism
- Trauma
